    "This is a classic coding problem that provides a lot of opportunity for creativity and ingenuity, in part because there are a number of ways to approach the problem. As is often the case, there are also a lot of small optimizations that can be found depending on what you are prioritizing. Today I want to look at a few ways to approach this problem, ending with a look at a special method I have always found fascinating: the **Sieve of Eratosthenes**.\n",

    "Before we jump into the code, a quick mathematics refresher: what is a prime number? A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller whole numbers. Alternatively, it is a number that is only cleanly divisible by itself and 1. Any whole number greater than 1 that is not a prime number is a composite number. So the first challenge will be to determine whether a given number is prime or composite.\n",
    "\n",
    "For my first attempt, I kept things basic. The function below takes a given object (x) and checks if it is an integer. If so, it checks if it is greater than 2. Then, it attempts to divide that number by each integer between 2 and x. If any of the results are a whole number, then that number is a composite, not a prime."

    "It works, but how can we improve it? One way would be to increase the speed. For small numbers the computing time is negligible, but for larger numbers, the function is dividing x by every smaller integer. Another way to put this is that `x` is divided `x-2` times. This means if `x=100`, then the function is performing division 98 times. Can this be reduced? Yes!\n",
    "\n",
    "To think about how we can reduce the number of calculations, let's use `x=16` as an example. To find if it is a prime, we are currently dividing 16 by each number from 2-15. Since 16 is not a prime, we know that at least one combination of whole numbers can be multiplied to equal 16, but what are the combinations? Let's check each possibility by hand:\n",

For example: `16/2=8`, so we immediately know 16 is not prime. But if the number *is* prime, the current function still has to check every smaller whole number before it can make the determination of prime or composite.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the example above, however, demonstrates that we don't actually need to check every single combination. As we can see, `2*8` and `8*2` both equal 16. We only find unique product pairs up to 4 (`2*8 and 4*4`). What about if `x=36`? In this case, the product pairs are:\n",

    "18 * 2  <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This time we see that there are no unique pairs after n=6. Do you see the connection yet? In each case, we only need to check each whole number up to $\\sqrt{x}$. So when `x=16`, we can stop checking after $\\sqrt{16}$, which is 4. When `x=36`, we stop checking after $\\sqrt{36}$, which is 6. Here is the updated function with this addition:"

    "Great, it works! But this is terribly inefficient. There are a lot of repetitive and unnecessary steps since the function has to individually check every number in the list and perform many calculations to determine if each is prime. How can we solve for primes without having to prove each number up to `x` is prime?\n",
    "\n",
    "One answer lies in the **Sieve of Eratosthenes**, an algorithm first referenced in the 2nd Century CE Ancient Greek text *Introduction to Algebra* and attributed to Eratosthenes of Cyrene, a Greek mathematician from the 3rd Century BCE. It is worth noting that this is not the only 'prime sieve' to exist. In fact, there are a number of sieves that have been developed that are even more effective than the Sieve of Eratosthenes, but Eratosthenes' is one of the simplest and least complex, so it is perfect for our current purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method functions in a seemingly backwards fashion. Instead of identifying all the prime numbers up to a given number `x`, the Sieve of Eratosthenes identifies all the composite numbers and removes them, leaving only the prime numbers! Though this seems backwards, it turns out that identifying composities is a lot easier than identifying primes. If we think back to our earlier attempts, we can see why this is.\n",
    "\n",
    "When determining if `x` is prime, we first had to divide `x` by every smaller integer betweeen 2 and `x`. Even after our improvement of using $\\sqrt{x}$ instead of `x`, there are still a lot of calculations that need to be performed before we can verify that `x` is prime, and the number of calculations increases exponentially as `x` increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, how easy is it to determine if a given number is *not prime* (composite)? The answer, as it turns out, is very easy. One way is to simply find all the multiples of each prime number, starting with 2. We can eliminate the multiples since they can't be prime if they are divisible by 2. So with a minimal number of calculations, we have effectively removed half of the possible numbers from consideration (all even numbers). The next remaining number in the list of possible primes is 3. So we then remove all multiples of 3. The next remaining number is 5, because 4 was removed from consideration as it was a multiple of 2. We repeat this process up to $\\sqrt{x}$ until we have removed all composite numbers, leaving only the primes! Visually, it looks like this:\n",
